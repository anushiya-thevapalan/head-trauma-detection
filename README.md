# Head Trauma Detection

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)]()

A smartphone app that detects concussion and other traumatic brain injuries could be used to determine whether someone whether a football player, a soldier in battle, or an elderly person who has fallen should be further assessed for concussion or other brain injury. 
Our app uses a smartphone’s video camera and deep learning tools to identify changes in the pupil’s response to light. Pupil Screen stimulates the patient’s eyes using the smartphone’s flash and, using the camera, records an eight-second video of the eyes as the pupils constrict in response to the flash. 
The recorded video is processed using our convolutional neural networks that track the pupil diameter over time and give the results.
